You are all that matters
The one I want
Longing just to know you
With all my heart
I throw my shame away
All of my sin erased
This isn't the end of the story
I'll trust in what you say
Told me I'll be ok
It's turning around for your glory
I know when the fight comes
I'ma keep my head up, hey
You won't let me down, let me down
With me in the middle
Middle of my battle hey
You will never be the one to walk away
I was made to know you
From the start
Love without condition
Is who you are, who you are
I throw my shame away
All of my sin erased
This isn't the end of the story
I'll trust in what you say
Told me I'll be ok
It's turning around for your glory
I know when the fight comes
I'ma keep my head up, hey
You won't let me down, let me down
With me in the middle
Middle of my battle, hey
You will never be the one to walk away
I know when the fight comes
I'ma keep my head up, hey
You won't let me down, let me down
With me in the middle
Middle of my battle, hey
You will never be the one to walk away
You will never be the one to walk away
You will never be the one to walk away
I know when the fight comes
I'ma keep my head up, hey
You won't let me down
With me in the middle
Middle of my battle, hey
You will never be the one to walk away
I know when the fight comes
I'ma keep my head up, hey
You won't let me down, let me down
With me in the middle
Middle of my battle, hey
You will never be the one to walk away
I know when the fight comes
I'ma keep my head up, hey
You won't let me down, let me down
With me in the middle
Middle of my battle, hey
You will never be the one to walk away
You will never be the one to walk away
You will never be the one to walk away
